# A blog about Spark, data science and computing stuff

## Batteries included

To add a blogpost either:
 a. Add a file in in posts, e.g.: /_posts/2016-01-01-new-post.md.
 b. Add a .ipynb to /notebooks, then run rake from in the root project folder, then edit the new file and copy it into _posts.

Be careful of the file naming convention.
